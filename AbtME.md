- 👋 Hello, I’m @HUchie >.<
- 👀 I’m interested in JRPG games such as the Persona series and Omori, but I also like psychological games such as fractured minds.
   I also enjoy reading, I'm currently reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky, and I really like listening to music. 
- 🌱 I’m mostly studying 4 school and I'm busy with hobbies, o I don't exactly have a lot of time 4 these projects
- 💞️ I’m not really looking 2 collaborate because like I said I don't have the time right now 2 work on my projects
- 📫 How 2 reach me ... I'd rather not :3
